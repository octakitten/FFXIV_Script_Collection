Hi there! So you play a healer in Final Fantasy XIV Online, right? And you'd like to be able to use mouseover macros in combat, but can't because of the game's limitations, right?
These scripting utilities I've collected here allow for healers to use mouseover macros to heal and provide buffs, 
as well as use timers and notification windows to track your DOT and DPS Cooldown.

Here's how to use these files:

1) Install AutoHotKey. This is a utility for Windows PCs only, so Linux and Mac users won't be able to use these files. You can install AutoHotKey from this link:
https://www.autohotkey.com/

2a) You will need to change your FFXIV character's ingame keybindings to the ones used in these scripts. I've provided sample "HOTBAR.DAT" and "KEYBIND.DAT" files for you if you 
don't mind using my character's hotbar and keybinding setup. Just copy and paste those two files from the "keybinds_hotbars_setup" folder here into the following file folder
C:\Users\[your_username_here]\Documents\My Games\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\FFXIV_CHR[some_numbers_here]
If you have multiple characters you may need to figure out which folder contains your main character's ui files. This will probably
be the folder that has been most recently modified. 

If you'd rather change your hotbars manually so as not to mess up your non-healer jobs and etc., continue to part 2b.

2b) I'll provide a list of the keybindings you need to use here. Just change your actions around on your hotbars so that they line up with these keybinds and 
things should work:

White Mage:

Attacks:
1 - Glare
2 - Dia
4 - Afflatus Misery
5 - Presence of Mind

Mouseover spells:
3 - Regen
Shift+1 - Cure 1
Shift+2 - Cure 2
Shift+3 - Cure 3
Shift+4 - Tetragrammaton
Shift+5 - Divine Benison
Shift+E - Afflatus Solace
R - aquaveil
Shift+C - Benediction
F - Rescue
Shift+F - Esuna
V - Raise

3) Once you have AutoHotKey installed and your keybinds set up for the script to work, simply run the "whm_keybinds.ahk" file by double clicking
and it will run in the background. You can close it by pressing Shift+F1, as it will interferre with your normal typing sometimes. 
After that, have fun!
