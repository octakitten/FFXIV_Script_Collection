FFXIV Scripting Utilities

This is a collection of scripting utilities intended for use with the video game Final Fantasy XIV Online. These scripts provide a little bit of quality of life changes to the game,
however they do not "bot" or automate actions within the game. Rather, they make the life of the player easier in a couple ways.
These scripts provide access to mouseover macros for healers that do not lag (at least not significantly so), as well as timers for a healer's "DOT" effect and "DPS Cooldown". 
Also included is a stopwatch utility that can track how long a given fight has lasted.

These scripts do not hook into the game files or read system memory at all. They do not interact with the game in any way that the player might not. They might be considered by some to be
against the TOS of FFXIV, as they are technically a piece of third party software that conferrs a game advantage. However, the developers of the game are unlikely to ban you for using these
scripts, unless you explicity talk about it in the ingame chat, and the benefit that they provide is not only just miniscule quality of life changes, but such benefits are already provided for
PC users by other third-party tools (such as many of the plugins for Dalamud, which injects into system memory to alter the game process).

No warranty of usefulness or safety is provided with these files, and you will need to follow the instructions provided in the INSTRUCTIONS.TXT file in order to set up and use these
utilities properly. Moreover, you may find that they do not suit your needs even after following the instructions. I accept commissions to modify these scripts and/or develop other scripting 
utilities for your personal needs over on Gumroad at
